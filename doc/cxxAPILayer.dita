<title>C++ topic types</title>
<shortdesc>The C++ API specialization provides a set of specific topic types
that can describe a C++ application programming interface (API) library.
The C++ language-specific API topic types are specialized from the generic
API reference topic types. This specialization permits the sharing of the
basic semantics and processing. </shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><title>Description</title><p>The C++ modules describe the C++ topic
types and their contained elements. For example, the cxxClass module describes
all the elements necessary to describe a C++ class.</p></section>
